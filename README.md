# User Research Contextual Inquiry
## Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements
What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
> This project will support users in being able to make appointments to get government documents, and thus make other appointments more easily. This will hopefully make the experience for users easier.
What is the basic need involved for that activity?
> This activity helps the user quickly and easily make appointments. This is a very time confusing activity although all citizens almost all citizens need and have a current ID.
What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
> Currently, citizens make via the phone, walking in and waiting, or making an appointment online. Making an appointment online is the easiest of these solutions.
What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
> The biggest current limitation on the site is the layout. Many users may get confused as nothing strongly stands out to the naked eye. Users who are not experienced with technology may also have issues with navigating the sit.
## Step02: Target users
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
> Demographic: Consumers looking for a new ID since they turned 21. Likely college students.
> Preferences: Consumer wants a quick and easy experience with making their appointment. 
> Expertise: No expertise is needed to use the site but general website knowledge is a huge plus.
When would the users do that activity?
> Users usually do this activity in their free time when they need to make an appointment.
What would the users do to complete that activity?
> Users usually google New York ID and click on the governement website link. They then navigate through the website to find their desired section, in this case ID renewal.
## Step03: Pick an qualitative research method
>I will be using both overt observation and participatory interacton. I picked overt observation as I will be in person conducting the research with the participant and this observation style is fitting. I picked participatory interaction as I conducted the research with my roommate who fit the target demographic described above and was interacting with her throughout. Please find the materials used in the next section.
## Step04: Plan the details
>I will observe my participant in her home on her own device. I will observe her finding the "How to renew a license" article as well as SDFGHJ, which both include various steps. I will be interacting with my user through overt observation and participatory interaction while recording both video and audio..

## Reflection
> Doing this test on a government website was definitely good to get a fresh look at UI/UX design. In this way, I was able to relate more to the user in the study as I am not very knowledged on government websites either. All parts of my interview went well as I was interviewing my roommate, someone who I am very confortable with, and was also using a site that I have been a user of before. This proves to be useful information as I should aim to maintain this level of comfort with all users in interviews and/or studys to get accurate results and have the users feel at ease. While going through the interview, I realized that I was giving my user optioins on things to say. This is something I need to limit moving forward as we want the user's original and raw ideas. The most useful part of the process was watching my user navigate the site with only oral direction. This allowed me to see exactly when and where there are issues with the site design. The methods I used in this user research contextual inquiry proved to be useful as they provided me with the answers that I needed regarding the navigation of the government site.
